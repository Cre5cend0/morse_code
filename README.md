# Morse-code

Morse code is a method used in telecommunication to encode text characters as standardized sequences of two different signal durations, called dots and dashes or dits and dahs. Morse code is named after Samuel Morse, an inventor of the telegraph.

There is no distinction between upper and lower case letters. Each Morse code symbol is formed by a sequence of dots and dashes. The dot duration is the basic unit of time measurement in Morse code transmission. The duration of a dash is three times the duration of a dot. Each dot or dash within a character is followed by period of signal absence, called a space, equal to the dot duration. The letters of a word are separated by a space of duration equal to three dots, and the words are separated by a space equal to seven dots.[1] To increase the efficiency of encoding, Morse code was designed so that the length of each symbol is approximately inverse to the frequency of occurrence of the character that it represents in text of the English language. Thus the most common letter in English, the letter "E", has the shortest code: a single dot. 


Morse Code timing rules · The length of a dot is 1 time unit. · A dash is 3 time units. · The space between symbols (dots and dashes) of the same letter is 1 time unit.

- ## For a demo of how to run the program, see test.py file. 
>> You can Encrypt a message, Decrypt a message and also Play an Encrypted message in morse format. 

- ### If you're unable to play the sound, run the following command in your env terminal 
`$ pip3 install playsound`
